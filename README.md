# Gender-classification Using deep learning Models
This project uses deep learning techniques to classify gender based on facial images. A mobile_net model , Vgg 19 model ,Vgg 16 model and Sequential model is trained on a dataset of male and female faces to achieve accurate classification. The model is implemented using TensorFlow/Keras and tested on real-world data.  
**Key Features**:  
Preprocessing of image dataset (resizing, normalization). 
Mobile_net model , Vgg 19 model ,Vgg 16 model and Sequential model deep learning model for gender classification.
